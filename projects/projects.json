With having a yearly occupation rate of over 80% it is regarded as one of the best hotels to stay in Cape Town. This popularity demands that all the intricate systems that keep the hotel functioning at 100% should be maintained and kept in perfect working order.

The boiler was replaced and a full operation system design review was done on the working of the boiler to provide redundancy for the future.",
